# Reinforcement Learning Car Simulation 🚗🤖

This project demonstrates a **Reinforcement Learning agent** built in **Unity** using custom **Neural Networks** and **Genetic Algorithms**.  
The goal: evolve a self-driving car agent that learns to navigate efficiently.

---

## 🔑 Features
- **Custom Neural Network** in Unity (C#) with tunable hidden layers (see `NNet.cs`).
- **Genetic Algorithm Framework** (see `GeneticManager.cs`):
  - Selection, crossover, and mutation operations.
  - Fitness-based repopulation loop to evolve agents.  
- **Simulation**: Cars drive in Unity environment, evolving every generation.  
- **Results**: Top-performing agent achieved by **Generation 2, Genome 25**.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `GeneticManager.cs` → Handles population management, fitness evaluation, and reproduction.
- `NNet.cs` → Implements feed-forward neural network with customizable layers.  
- Unity Scene → Contains car prefab and track for training.
